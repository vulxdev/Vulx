---- This was the initial idea we used for creating Vulx ----

Project Description / Revision

How will the frontend work?
The application will create a web based interface to allow users to select and edit settings.
Upon first launch the tab will open and function as followed.

[+] The page will display a welcome message, centralised on the page
[+] The page will ask some basic questions, for example: where is your valorant installed, have you downloaded the correct launcher ect.
[+] After this a quick promt to say, Consider checking out the developer with some links (a button under showing, no thanks or skip)
[+] This will take you to the main page, it will display some stats such as display name ect along with settings to edit every value of your profile.
[+] Settings can be saved locally to allow quick loading.

Display at the top Steps x/x (1/3)

On initial launch (Local save will set a boolean and save the selected options + the settings they change):

Ask if they'd like to use Discord RPC,
Ask if they would like to use experimental features
Promote the YouTube and Discord 

DiscordRPC Manager:

[+] Display Vulx in the status, this will contain the current rank
[+] It will also display the status selected if one is present.
[+] Two buttons will be located display Discord & YouTube

Note: This code will be easily accessible and will most likely be prone to skidding
